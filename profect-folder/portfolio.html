                <h2>Implement the ALAQAN system in our university</h2>
                <p>Long queues at checkout counters, especially during peak hours such as lunch 
                    breaks or class transitions. These queues create significant inconvenience for 
                    customers who are often pressed for time. Many students and staff are forced to 
                    either wait for extended periods, risking being late, or leave without purchasing 
                    anything, often staying hungry.</p>
