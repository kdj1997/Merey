        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>Working on these projects has helped me see how exciting and creative UX/UI design can be. 
            It’s been a chance for me to grow, try new things, and really understand how to create 
            something that works for people.</p>
        
        <h2>What was your role in each project? Which parts in each project did you specifically do?</h2>
        <p>In every project, I worked with the same team because I genuinely enjoyed collaborating 
            with them. My role in each project was to create sketches, storyboards, prototypes, and, 
            based on the feedback we received, finalize the design. I especially loved visualizing our 
            ideas because it made them feel more real and achievable. I can confidently say that I took 
            on a role similar to that of a product manager in our team, ensuring everything was organized 
            and on track.
        </p>

        <h2>What did you learn from completing each project? How did that influence your approach for the next project?</h2>
        <p>Each project we completed brought valuable feedback, which helped us identify and fix small gaps.
            We carried these lessons into our future projects, making improvements every step of the way.
            <ul>
                <li>First Project: During our presentation, the teacher asked, "How will your robot move between 
                    floors? Will it use the elevator?" Luckily, we had already addressed this in our storyboard, 
                    where we showed how the robot would navigate floors. Interestingly, I had almost forgotten that I
                     worked on this part until the question came up. This experience taught us to pay more attention 
                     to the finer details in future projects.</li>
                <li>Second Project: For this project, we focused on improving the Alaqan system. The teacher asked 
                    if we had reached out to the Alaqan team for feedback. This question made us realize that these 
                    projects are not just for grades—they can actually solve real-world problems, like those faced in 
                    SDU Market. It also showed us the importance of conducting more thorough background research and 
                    collaborating with existing teams to create better solutions.</li>
                <li>Third Project: For our final project, we recorded a video and received positive feedback.
                     However, looking back, I think we should have consulted our teacher for more detailed feedback. 
                     From our previous projects, we learned how important constructive feedback is for improving our 
                     work, and we missed that opportunity here.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>How has your overall design philosophy and perspective changed over the duration of the course?</h2>
        <p>Over the course of this journey, my perspective on design and technology has changed significantly. 
            I used to believe that if someone didn’t immediately understand how to use something, it meant they 
            were falling behind in technology. But now, I see it differently. When I used to hear the phrase "good design," 
            I would only think about how it looked. I didn’t realize the importance of practicality and functionality. The 
            essence of good design lies in simplifying human interactions and making systems easy to use, even when they 
            are complex. Reading the books and articles recommended by our teacher really expanded my view. I began to notice 
            how much design influences our daily lives and how it shapes the way we perceive and interact with the world. 
            I now understand that simple, intuitive designs are the most impactful and make our lives easier in ways we
             often overlook.
        </p>

        <h2>What do you think UX and UI is now?</h2>
        <p>As the course comes to an end, here’s what I’ve come to understand:
            <ul>
                <li>User Experience is about understanding the needs and 
                    goals of users and designing a product that provides an 
                    intuitive and satisfying experience.</li>
                <li>User Interface focuses on the visual and interactive elements, 
                    such as typography, color schemes, buttons, and layouts. 
                    These elements not only make a product visually appealing 
                    but also guide users through the interface effectively.</li>
                <li>Together, UX and UI complement each other to create a harmonious 
                    product that is functional, aesthetically pleasing, and easy to use.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
